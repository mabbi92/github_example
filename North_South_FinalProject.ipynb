    "Tourism in Portugal serves millions of international and domestic tourists. Tourists visit to see cities, historic landmarks, enjoy beaches, or religious sites. In 2017, Portugal had 23 million visitors. The most popular destinations were Lisbon, Porto, Fatima, the Portuguese Riviera and the Algarve. This project aims to explore the differences between Lisboa and Porto, the two biggest Portugese cities. In 2018 these two cities had more tourists than London or Barcelona and have had an icredible growth over the past years. During this project I expect to explore the different neighbourhoods in both cities, compare and contrast them and see why they are so popular among tourists. "
